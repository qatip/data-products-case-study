# Executive Overview

## What this is
A hands-on case study showing how a bank can manage **data as a product** across:
- **ODP** (Origin Data Platform)
- **FDP** (Foundational Data Platform)
- **CDP** (Consumer Data Platform)
with **trust** (DQ, reconciliation, lineage) and **governance** (labels/metadata) built in.

## Why it matters (banking context)
- Regulatory trust & traceability (e.g., financial/management reporting, BCBS239 spirit).
- Reuse and consistency: publish once, consume many.
- Automation reduces toil: metadata drives deployment and checks.

## What youâ€™ll see in the lab
- **ODP**: transactions landing + integrity checks.
- **FDP**: FX rates + harmonisation to GBP.
- **CDP**: curated, business-ready views (daily/monthly totals).
- **Controls**: DQ + reconciliation + labels + a lightweight catalog with badges.

## Outcomes
- Understand a target operating model for data products on BigQuery.
- See how **business metadata** meets **technical metadata** in a catalog.
- Leave with Terraform + PowerShell you can reuse.
